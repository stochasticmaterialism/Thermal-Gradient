Business Case: 
          Production of good quality metallurgical coke with fixed carbon (75% – 80%), ash (17% - 18%), volatile matter (VM) (0.3% - 0.5%), and moisture (3% - 4%) as per the requirements of the direct customers, i.e., A to F blast furnaces (BF) there decreasing the coke rate in hot metal production.
           

Problem Statement:
          The average thermal gradient between 01/10/2022 and 31/12/2022 was 17.36 for battery #8 and 18.26 for battery #9 with standard deviations of 20.96 and 21.57, respectively. During this period approximately 17% and 20% of the ovens had a thermal gradient greater than 40 ᵒC for batteries #8 and #9 respectively. These ovens must be identified and the critical parameters affecting the thermal gradient must be studied and controlled.  


Goal: 
        To improve the thermal gradient in the aforesaid batteries within 40℃.


In Scope :
          Battery #8 & #9, 


Out of Scope: 
          Battery #7 and #10 & #11. 


Deliverables :
	Calculate and control the mean and standard deviation of thermal gradient.
